routine reminder – your lightweight habit tracker

Routines are an integral part of a content mind. Sometimes, it is challenging to remember habits that have proven helpful. Routine reminder is here to help you stay focused. It is a minimalist app that enables you to create daily or weekly routine lists that refresh automatically on the coming morning. You can cross routines off and receive immediate feedback on how consistent you have been achieving your habit goals.

Project files like wireframes, endpoints and entities can be found in the frontend repo. If you are interested, check out the “project-files” folder.
